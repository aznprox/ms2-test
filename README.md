# MS2-Test

## Automated Entry

The purpose of this application is to showcase python 3.7 usage.

The application is a bot that automates the process of running a set of commands in a application. 

# Dependencies

`Pyautogui` - It comes with prebuilt modules for enmulating mouse input and keyboard inputs, however the keyboard input did not work, because the application only takes VK key scan codes for DX11. It also has prebuilt modules for taking snapshots, and image recognition. 

`ctypes` - Built in python module that loads DDL. It is used to load OS libraries for emulating keypresses.
